            <h2>About USPS</h2>
            <p>
                The USPS is going to make it more expensive to ship packages to Alaska and Hawaii by adding a new postal zone. Sellers who offer free shipping may have to think about adjusting their product pricing to account for the structural cost change if they use the Postal Service to ship their items - even an occasional shipment to the new Zone 10 could become impactful.

                Sellers in those 2 states who source inventory, materials and supplies from the contiguous United States will also have to factor higher costs into their product prices.

                Industry trade publication OMG (Official Mail Guide) covered the publication of the USPS July 2024 Release Review where the plans for a new shipping zone for competitive (not market dominant) rates were published.

                Zone 10 would be added in pricing tables for Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express, and USPS Ground Advantage products. 

                It appears even Priority Mail Flat Rate packages would be more costly for Zone 10 than existing zones: "A separate rate structure will be implemented to allow Flat Rate Products (Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express) to have a separate price for Zone 10 and also for Zone 9 which includes the Freely Associated States (FAS)."

                If you need a refresher course on postal zones, Pirate Ship has a guide. Zones indicate how far away a recipient is from a shipper. Roughly speaking, Zone 1 is within a 50-mile radius of the shipper; while Zone 8 is 1,801 miles or greater away from the shipper. Zone 9 is for destinations in US territories (and some military addresses), PirateShip explains.

                The Anchorage Daily News heard about the new rate structure for its citizens in December and reported: "Most destinations that Alaskans receive mail from in the Lower 48 fall under Zone 8 pricing. The Postal Service stated that Zone 10 prices are intended to be 5% higher than Zone 8 prices after January's rate increase, according to a notice filed online."

                Not surprisingly, the newspaper reported that Alaska's congressional delegation was not pleased about the change, with one Senator saying no state should be punished by the federal government because of geography.

                We've seen little reported about Zone 10, and it's surprising online marketplaces haven't rallied buyers and sellers to lobby Congress against it.

                eBay added a new "Verified Purchase" designation on feedback, its latest effort to copy features found on Amazon reviews. But the unannounced change had sellers bewildered when they noticed it as early as January 30, 2024, when a user started a thread on the eBay discussion boards titled "Feedback - Verified purchase" asking if it was a new feature and what purpose it served.

                A user also asked about the feature on a popular forum for trading cards hosted by Blowout Cards on Friday. "When did eBay add the words "Verified Purchase," someone asked in the title of a post that went on to say: "Just noticed that the words "Verified Purchase" now appear in feedback lines.....has it always been there and I just didn't notice it or is it something new? Maybe it's their way of starting to fight shill bidding?"

                Someone replied saying they believed it was a new feature and said, "I figured it's trying to mimic Amazon, and have reviews for verified purchases like everything else."

                They also asked what would be an "unverified" purchase on eBay, since all feedback is tied to a transaction on eBay, unlike product reviews on Amazon, where a help page on "Amazon Verified Purchase Reviews" explains: "Reviews without this (Verified Purchase) label can also be helpful. For example, a customer buys an item from a different company, but wants to share their opinion on Amazon."

                The person on the Blowout forums also pointed out that eBay had added an option for buyers to upload photos when leaving feedback, "which is also in line with places like Amazon," they wrote. 

                Interestingly, eBay referred to feedback as "reviews" in a December 18th post discussing the addition of photos to feedback, writing in part, "these updates will help to add trust to reviews, increase buyer confidence and drive conversion for your listings."

                No matter how much eBay tweaks feedback, it's tied to specific transactions between a buyer and a seller, not to particular products. Nevertheless, do you think eBay has the right idea by trying to make its feedback more like reviews?

                Elliott Management gained a seat on Etsy's board of directors after becoming a "sizeable" investor in the company. Despite the low-key announcement from Etsy today (February 1, 2024), this is a major development and one that is generally dreaded by management and boards of public companies - just ask Athenahealth founder Jonathan Bush.

                Elliott Management partner Marc Steinberg said in Etsy's press release today that he believes there is an opportunity for significant value creation. "I am looking forward to working with the Board and supporting Josh and the team as they execute on initiatives to improve the customer experience, accelerate top- and bottom-line growth, and drive long-term value."

                Some companies choose to submit to (or collaborate with) activist investors, as PayPal chose to do. Others fight to varying degrees, openly or covertly, as eBay had done when targeted first by Carl Icahn and later by Elliot Management in 2019.

                Sheelah Kolhatkar outlined Elliott Management's approach in a 2017 piece the New Yorker ("Paul Singer, Doomsday Investor - The head of Elliott Management has developed a uniquely adversarial, and immensely profitable, way of doing business"). Elliott has modified its approach since then, according to a 2022 piece in Forbes.

                Carl Icahn had pressured eBay to split from PayPal in 2015, which had a monumental impact on sellers. Elliott Management pressured eBay to sell StubHub and its classifieds business in 2019, which had a less direct impact on sellers. 

                It's unclear what changes Etsy will make as a result of Elliott Management's influence. Unlike in 2019 when Elliott wrote the infamous Enhancing eBay manifesto outlining its criticisms, the only hints of what lie ahead are contained in Etsy's press release this morning.

                <h2>Upskilling for working professionals</h2>
                <p>
As the business ecosystem is fast transforming, the upskilling of working professionals has become imperative. The rapid digital revolution and high-tech disruptions are impacting every aspect of our work, how we communicate, and how we function. Consequently, there is a strong need for professionals to incessantly enhance their skills and knowledge to stay relevant and succeed in their professions. Let us understand why upskilling is the need of the hour for working professionals:

Rapid Workforce Evolution 

The pace of technological change and disruption in the workplace is constantly accelerating. To stay relevant in their industries, individuals must continually update their skills and learn about the latest tools and practices.

A study by the World Economic Forum has highlighted the pressing need for reskilling on a global level. The COVID-19 pandemic has further broadened the skills gap, predominantly in careers that depend deeply on technology. Another report by McKinsey & Company indicated that 87% of businesses are already experiencing or are anticipated to experience a skills shortage in the coming future. 

Professional Development and Growth Prospects

Upskilling is indispensable for professionals looking to improve their leadership capabilities and further climb the ladder in their current roles. A survey by LinkedIn showed, 94% of employees would stay longer at a company that invested in their career growth. By looking for prospects to enhance their know-how and attain new skills pertinent to their sector and desired leadership positions, professionals can position themselves for growth and take advantage of new opportunities within their organizations.

Adapting to Organizational Changes

Upskilling equips professionals with the ability to adapt to organizational changes, such as mergers, acquisitions, or shifts in business strategies. Professionals who possess a diverse skill set can be more flexible in taking on new responsibilities or transitioning to different roles within their organizations.

Helps Align with Goals

Upskilling programs help professionals align their short-terms and long-term career objectives. By taking a comprehensive approach, skilling programs can help individuals achieve their goals successfully. Professionals who prudently evaluate their goals, brainstorm their needs, and handpick the courses that are in sync with their organizational needs can benefit immensely. It can lead to successful career trajectories and encourage an optimistic and progressive work culture.

Provides Peer Learning and Collaboration Opportunities

Peer-to-peer (P2P) learning has been recognized as one of the most effective methods for encouraging professional growth in the business environment. Employees are usually more comfortable acquiring new skills when they can learn from and interact with their peers. Upskilling programs that support peer collaboration and knowledge sharing can offer employees greater opportunities for professional development and enhance communication within teams, benefiting both individuals and organizations.

Offers Mentoring Relationships

Having a mentor can profoundly influence professional growth. Research reveals that employees who have mentors are 5x more likely to be promoted. Upskilling Programs can provide valuable mentorship guidance, advice, and support from industry experts. They can help navigate challenges, offer feedback, and share insights into effective leadership practises. It can accelerate professional development and expand networks, opening doors to new opportunities.

Upskilling working professionals has become the need of the hour in today’s dynamic business environment. The constant digital transformation, developing job market, and need for new skills demand that individuals continuously boost their knowledge and competencies. Moreover, upskilling is a continuous process. As technology and industry trends are always evolving, professionals must stay relevant. Continuous learning and upskilling highlight an individual’s adaptability and personal growth, making them valuable contributors to their workplace.
